# 英文自我介绍 (2分钟版本)

Good morning/afternoon. My name is Li Dongyao, and I'm very pleased to have this opportunity to introduce myself.

I graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University with both my bachelor's and master's degrees in Civil Engineering. Although my academic background is in civil engineering, I discovered my passion for software development during my studies and successfully transitioned into the tech industry.

I have over 4 years of professional software development experience. I started my career at OPPO in 2020 as a software development intern, where I worked on porting image algorithms to MediaTek and Qualcomm DSP platforms. My performance during the internship earned me a top-tier offer, and I joined OPPO full-time in 2021 as a software development engineer.

During my three years at OPPO, I served as a core developer for big data on-device projects and logging frameworks. My main responsibilities included developing Android Native layer daemon processes, implementing event-driven design patterns, and working extensively with C++, STL libraries, and concurrent programming. I also led the development of performance and power consumption analytics using Android's native StatsD framework, covering the entire pipeline from data collection, processing, storage, and cloud upload.

Since December 2024, I've been working at Huawei as a software development engineer in the OpenHarmony department, where I've achieved A-level performance and obtained C++ Trusted Professional certification.

My technical expertise spans multiple areas: I'm proficient in C++, Python, Java, Kotlin, and Rust. I have extensive experience with Android development at both the application and native layers, including SQLite database operations, AIDL inter-process communication, and performance optimization. I'm also skilled in Linux development environments and have project management experience, having led cross-team collaborations and mentored junior engineers.

I'm particularly passionate about system-level programming, performance optimization, and building robust, scalable solutions. I believe my diverse technical background and hands-on experience make me a strong fit for this position.

Thank you for your time, and I'm happy to answer any questions you may have.
